This is a Julia script with a dedicated environment (see Project.toml).

A - Make sure you work in the current folder.

B - Make sure you activate the project:
1) Switch to package mode by typing: ``]``

2) Activate the environment by typing: `activate .`

3) Upon success this should look like: `(CoesiteQuartzGarnet1D) pkg> `

C - Instantiate the project (the first time you run it), type: `instantiate`

This will download and precompile all dependencies. Then it should be fine.
